# Allegro-txt2vid-pinokio
A Pinokio Install Script for the [Rhymes Allegro](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Allegro) text-to-video model.

## Sources
* Installs a Pinokio fork: https://github.com/pinokiofactory/Allegro-txt2vid
* Initial Gradio UI and associated code borrowed from: https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/allegro-text2video
* RIFE Interpolation Model from [AlexWortega/RIFE](https://huggingface.co/AlexWortega/RIFE)


## Important Notes
* Can take over an hour to generate a result. Hopefully will be optimized soon. But yeah, 1 hour on a 3090.  4090 ~30 minutes. 
* My GPU warms me at night. 
* 12GB VRAM may be sufficient to run, although it does briefly spike high in a couple of places, so make sure you haven't disabled SYSMEM fallback. 
* After the inference Steps have completed, there's a vae decode phase that can take quite a while. So don't panic and stop it prematurely!


* Img2vid is in the works apparently: https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Allegro/issues/8
* Yes, it's not (yet) optimized for consumer GPUs: https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Allegro/issues/20

Allegro is a powerful text-to-video model that generates high-quality videos up to 6 seconds at 15 FPS and 720p resolution from simple text input.

## News 🔥
 - [24/10/30] 🚀 We release multi-card inference code and PAB in [Allegro-VideoSys](https://github.com/nightsnack/Allegro-VideoSys). With VideoSys framework, the inference time can be further reduced to 3 mins (8xH100) and 2 mins (8xH100+PAB). We also opened a PR to the original [VideoSys repo](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/VideoSys).

 - [24/10/29] 🎉Congratulations that Allegro is merged into diffusers! Currently Allegro is supported in `0.32.0-dev0.` It will be integrated in the next release version. So for now, please use `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git@9214f4a3782a74e510eff7e09b59457fe8b63511` to install diffuser dev version. See [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/rhymes-ai/Allegro) for more details.

## Quick Start
### Single Inference
1. Download the [Allegro GitHub code](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Allegro).
   
2. Install the necessary requirements.
   
   - Ensure Python >= 3.10, PyTorch >= 2.4, CUDA >= 12.4. For details, see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Allegro/blob/main/requirements.txt).  
    
   - It is recommended to use Anaconda to create a new environment (Python >= 3.10) to run the following example.  
   
3. Download the [Allegro model weights](https://huggingface.co/rhymes-ai/Allegro).
   
4. Run inference.
   
    ```python
    python single_inference.py \
    --user_prompt 'A seaside harbor with bright sunlight and sparkling seawater, with many boats in the water. From an aerial view, the boats vary in size and color, some moving and some stationary. Fishing boats in the water suggest that this location might be a popular spot for docking fishing boats.' \
    --save_path ./output_videos/test_video.mp4 \
    --vae your/path/to/vae \
    --dit your/path/to/transformer \
    --text_encoder your/path/to/text_encoder \
    --tokenizer your/path/to/tokenizer \
    --guidance_scale 7.5 \
    --num_sampling_steps 100 \
    --seed 42
    ```
  
    Use `--enable_cpu_offload` to offload the model into CPU for less GPU memory cost (about 9.3G, compared to 27.5G if CPU offload is not enabled), but the inference time will increase significantly.

5. (Optional) Interpolate the video to 30 FPS.

    It is recommended to use [EMA-VFI](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/EMA-VFI) to interpolate the video from 15 FPS to 30 FPS.
  
    For better visual quality, please use imageio to save the video.

### Multi-Card Inference
We release multi-card inference code and PAB in [Allegro-VideoSys](https://github.com/nightsnack/Allegro-VideoSys). 

## Limitation
- The model cannot render celebrities, legible text, specific locations, streets or buildings.

## Future Plan
- [x] Multiple GPU inference and further speed up (PAB)
- [ ] Text & Image-To-Video (TI2V) video generation
- [ ] Motion-controlled video generation
- [ ] Visual quality enhancement
